+/ask what changes need to be made to this repo to make it work with an existing linode instance running docker, behind a traefik reverse proxy, with named network traefik_web, named private network mysql-private? Describe the changes needed for each file.

+can you apply changes to file #1?

# 2025-04-03 17:25:13.672884

# 2025-04-03 17:56:00.689663

# 2025-04-03 18:09:11.430553
+/ask I interrupted the last action becuase the third file is not the one you were updating. Did you commit anything before I interrupted you?

# 2025-04-03 18:10:20.086896
+/ask based on out conversation you enumerated changes in four phases, docker-compose, setup-dc, then github worker, then readme.

# 2025-04-03 18:12:34.078826
+/ask just to reiterate, this is the remaining steps you mentioned: 3 .github/workflows/deploy.yml:
+
+ • Remove all DigitalOcean specific steps (doctl, droplet creation)
+ • Simplify to just require SSH key, Linode IP, and Mautic password
+ • Update secret checks
+ • Remove VPS provisioning steps
+ • Keep Docker deployment logic
+
+ 4 README.md:
+
+ • Update all DigitalOcean references to Linode
+ • Remove VPS creation instructions
+ • Add Traefik pre-requisites section
+ • Update monitoring/debugging instructions
+ • Update architecture diagram description
+
+ 5 nginx-virtual-host-template:
+
+ • Can be removed (Traefik handles routing)
+
+ 6 setup-vps.sh:
+
+ • Can be removed (using existing Linode)

# 2025-04-03 18:14:43.235915
+can you make the changes for the third step only?

+can you add all requirements covered and the ones that we have yet to cover unto the .requirements.md file as developement checklist to keep track of our work?

# 2025-04-03 18:24:29.612131
+the .requirements.md does not follow what we talked about. What we talked about starts on line 118-150 of .aider.chat.history.md

+/ask on deploy.yml, can you check step "Deploy to Server" and tell me how it is doing it?

# 2025-04-04 13:12:12.278780
+/ask with regard to the deploy.yml, the download setup-dc.log, step downloads which file? does it exist in this repo?

# 2025-04-04 13:28:30.486464
+/ask can you explain the ssh process for the Download setup-dc.log step?

# 2025-04-04 13:38:45.614026
+/ask how can check if the vps has ssh root access disabled?

# 2025-04-04 13:48:57.423689
+/ask I have verified that root login is not allowed. How would we modify the approach for a user with sudo privildges?

+/ask in our chat history (during our last exchange at line 1747), you mentioned some change needed in order to modify the approach to use a non sudo user. On step 5 (line 1747), there is command to create /var/www, why do we need to do this if SCRIPT_AFTER (one line 1706-1709 of the chat history) mentions that we create this directory as part of the deploy process?
